# General description:
A small project that consists of calibrating a thermocouple type T and then creating a A green house using raspberry pi.
# 1) Instrumentation:
In this part, we measured the temperature using a thermocouple type T. we used this data sheet: https://www.thermocoupleinfo.com/pdf/type-t-thermocouple-reference-table.pdf
# 2) Green house:
In the world of technology and agriculture, the "Greenhouse Temperature Control System Using Raspberry Pi" project helps in the maintenance crops by automating the process. This report delves into our pursuit of precise greenhouse temperature control, combining the power of a Raspberry Pi, the insight of a BME280 sensor, and the motor speed control using a PID controller. Beyond the realworld application, we explore the advantages of simulation using Proteus 8 professional, offering a holistic view of our system's capabilities. Our project showcases the harmony between technology and sustainable agriculture, promising a future of optimal plant growth and resource/time efficiency.
